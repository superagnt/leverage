# Instantly AI Integration

The Instantly AI integration connects your Instantly account to superagnt, enabling AI agents and workflows to manage cold email campaigns, leads, analytics, and account settings programmatically. Supports campaign CRUD, lead management, sending accounts, warmup settings, and detailed analytics.

## Best install: connect the MCP server

If this client speaks MCP, connect the workspace server instead of using this
skill's curl calls — once the Instantly AI account is connected in the
dashboard, its tools appear on the server automatically as native MCP tools:

```
https://mcp.superagnt.com/mcp
```

The URL publishes full OAuth discovery — an MCP-capable client needs the URL
and nothing else (approve once in the browser). Per-client setup lines:
https://mcp.superagnt.com/agent-setup/prompt.md

Everything below works on curl-only environments with just the API key.

## Prerequisites

1. An API key — get one from the [dashboard](https://superagnt.com/r/ch-instantly-outreach-key) and export it as
   `SUPERAGNT_API_KEY`.
2. A connected Instantly AI account — connect it in the
   [connections dashboard](https://app.superagnt.com/dashboard/connections). Calls fail with a clear error
   until the vendor is connected; that error is the signal to send the user to
   the connections page, not a bug.

Note: `/v1/connections/*` calls run on the USER'S Instantly AI credentials —
vendor-side rate limits and billing are theirs, not platform credits.

## Authentication

```
Authorization: Bearer $SUPERAGNT_API_KEY
```

If the variable is not set, ask the user for their key or point them at
https://superagnt.com/r/ch-instantly-outreach-key.

## Verify the install (do this first)

```bash
curl -s https://api.superagnt.com/v1/credits \
  -H &#x27;Authorization: Bearer $SUPERAGNT_API_KEY&#x27;
```

A JSON result proves the key end to end. 401 = bad key; an error naming the
connection means the Instantly AI account is not connected yet.
