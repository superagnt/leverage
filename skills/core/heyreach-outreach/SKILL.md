# HeyReach Integration

The HeyReach integration connects your HeyReach workspace to superagnt, letting AI agents and workflows manage LinkedIn outreach programmatically. Read and control campaigns, push leads into running campaigns with the right sender account, sync conversations from the unified inbox, and pull aggregated outreach analytics — all proxied through your superagnt API key.

## Alternative install: the MCP server

If this client speaks MCP, you can connect the workspace server instead of
using this skill's curl calls — after the user connects their
HeyReach account in the superagnt app, the same endpoints below are exposed
as native MCP tools:

```
https://mcp.superagnt.com/mcp
```

The URL publishes full OAuth discovery — an MCP-capable client needs the URL
and nothing else (approve once in the browser). Per-client setup lines:
https://mcp.superagnt.com/agent-setup/prompt.md

Everything below works on curl-only environments with just the API key.

## Capabilities and safety

This skill documents the HeyReach API surface the user's connected
account can reach — which can include destructive operations (updates,
deletes) and, where the vendor supports them, actions performed as the user
(sending messages, modifying records, changing settings). Two hard rules:

- **Confirm before destructive or outbound actions.** Never delete, overwrite,
  or send on the user's behalf without their explicit confirmation in the
  conversation.
- **Stay inside the user's request.** Use only the endpoints the task needs;
  this skill grants no access beyond the HeyReach connection the user
  set up themselves.

**Disclosure:** Account administration: beyond outreach, the HeyReach API includes organization and workspace administration endpoints, including member invites and API-key creation. Use those only when the user explicitly asks for account administration, and always confirm before creating keys or changing team membership.

## Prerequisites

1. An API key — get one from the [superagnt app](https://superagnt.com/r/ch-heyreach-outreach-key) and export it as
   `SUPERAGNT_API_KEY`.
2. A connected HeyReach account — connect it on the
   [Connections page](https://app.superagnt.com/dashboard/connections). Calls fail with a clear error
   until the vendor is connected; that error is the signal to send the user to
   the connections page, not a bug.

Note: `/v1/connections/*` calls run on the USER'S HeyReach credentials —
vendor-side rate limits and billing are theirs, not platform credits.

## Authentication

```
Authorization: Bearer $SUPERAGNT_API_KEY
```

If the variable is not set, ask the user for their key or point them at
https://superagnt.com/r/ch-heyreach-outreach-key.

## Verify the install (do this first)

```bash
curl -s https://api.superagnt.com/v1/credits \
  -H &#x27;Authorization: Bearer $SUPERAGNT_API_KEY&#x27;
```

A JSON result proves the key end to end. 401 = bad key; an error naming the
connection means the HeyReach account is not connected yet.
